# 15-puzzle
An implementation of the popular sliding game 15 puzzle.

Written in Java's AWT and Swing, the app utilizes GUI programming to host the board and its sliding tiles.

The objective of the game is to reorder the tiles such that the tiles are in ascending order, from left to right and top to bottom. 

To play, download the files and run "Game.java" !

Inspiration drawn from: https://github.com/patturtestsite/2048 

Current bugs/issues: Players are able to continue moving tiles even after solving the puzzle (after the tiles turn green and the puzzle has been solved, the only key that should elicit a response from the GUI interface should be the ENTER key to start a new game).
